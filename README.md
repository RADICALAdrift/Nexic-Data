# Nexic-Data

## ðŸ“‚ Current Structure

The main content includes categorized JSON files, such as:

- `CHANNEL_MAP_TWITCH_INDIE.json`
- `CHANNEL_MAP_TWITCH_EX_VSHOJO_EN.json`
- `CHANNEL_MAP_TWITCH_VCHIBAN.json`
- `CHANNEL_MAP_TWITCH_EX_VSHOJO_JP.json`
- More categories may be added over time...

Each JSON file defines a mapping of VTuber display names to their Twitch identifiers, and may include optional metadata (like tags or maturity rating) for future functionality.

Example entry:
```json
"Kson": [
  {
    "type": "twitch",
    "identifier": "ksonsouchou",
    "tags": ["mature", "variety"],
    "mature": true
  }
]
